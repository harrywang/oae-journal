In order to use Vagrant with AWS, you need to do the following:

Follow https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws to setup vagrant for aws. Make sure that ssh is allowed default security group

Modify puppet-hilary/Vagrantfile according to the example below. 
Note that this example use Ubuntu 12.04 ami and a medium instance


****************

# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # Use the “dummy” box to host
  config.vm.box = "dummy"

  # Share the backend and front-end code with vagrant.
  # It's assumed that Hilary and 3akai-ux are on the same level as puppet-hilary.
  # Note that puppet will change some files in these directories
  config.vm.synced_folder "../Hilary", "/opt/oae"
  config.vm.synced_folder "../3akai-ux", "/opt/3akai-ux"

  # Run a shell script that will do some basic bootstrapping and finally runs puppet.
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "provisioning/vagrant/init.sh"

  # configure aws
  config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
    aws.access_key_id = "your access key id"
    aws.secret_access_key = "your secret access key"
    aws.keypair_name = "your keypair name"

    aws.ami = "ami-7747d01e"
    aws.instance_type = "m1.medium"
    aws.tags = {
      'Name' => 'oae-demo'
    }

    override.ssh.username = "ubuntu"
    override.ssh.private_key_path = "full path to your private key"
  end

end

********************


Change web domain in puppet-hilary/environments/local/hiera/common.json to match your domain names

"web_domain": "yourdomain.com",

Change host names in puppet-hilary/environments/local/modules/localconfig/manifests/hostnames.pp to match your domain names

    host { 'admin.yourdomain.com': ip => '127.0.0.1' }
    host { 'tenant1.yourdomain.com': ip => '127.0.0.1' }
    host { 'tenant2.yourdomain.com': ip => '127.0.0.1' }
    host { 'tenant3.yourdomain.com': ip => '127.0.0.1' }

Add the following to puppet-hilary/provisioning/vagrant/init.sh 

# enable  multiverse repositories
echo "enable multiverse repositories"
sudo sed -i "/^# deb.*multiverse/ s/^# //" /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update

Restart server (sudo reboot) and assocate a fix IP to the new instance if necessary

Run "vagrant ssh", and go to /opt/oae folder and run "sudo service hilary restart" - wait for a few minutes, your OAE demo using aws should be ready!
